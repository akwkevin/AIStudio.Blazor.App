Axis can be bound to a specific field the Properties `XField` and `YField`. Certain charts offer additional fields like `Type`.

NOTE: The value passed to those options have to start with a lower key, even if the Property in your Model starts with an uppercase.
For a Property `CustomerName` you would have to pass `YField = "customerName"`
